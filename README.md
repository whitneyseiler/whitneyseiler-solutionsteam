## Whitney Seiler - Solutions Team Hiring Assignment

Hi there! Thanks for considering my application, and for giving me the chance to demo my skills and ability to catch up quickly on new technology. I had a great time learning how to use the Algolia API.

### In The Repo
In this repo you'll find the answers to the sample customer questions saved in the main directory as customer-questions.txt.
The script I used to convert the csv records, combine them with the existing json records and import to Algolia is also in the root directory, and is named convert-and-import.js. I ran this file using the "import-records" script in my package.json.

### Fine Print
This site is powered by Algolia, and was created as part of a hiring application for the Agolia Solutions Team.
