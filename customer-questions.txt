QUESTION 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking." 

Cheers,
George

ANSWER 1:
Hi George! 

Welcome to the Algolia family! I'm happy to help. :)

Let's start with your question about records and indexing. You can think of an index as the place where Algolia stores the data you'll need to perform searches. It's a bit like a database table, except it's optimized for searching and has some great options for customizing. A record is any data object you want to be able to search for, for instance a single product in an online store.

Custom Ranking is a great way to control the order of the results your searches return to improve the search experience. Useful metrics will depend on what your product is, but some great examples are number of sales, customer rating, views and likes. We have a great article about custom ranking here(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/ranking/custom-ranking/#metric-types), but don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions!

Happy searching!

QUESTION 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt


ANSWER 2:
Hi Matt!

Thank you for reaching out, and thank you for being a part of the Algolia community! We always want to hear feedback from our customers. I can understand why navigating the dashboard over and over could be frustrating.

Did you know that you can clear and delete your index from your text editor using <index.clearIndex(callback)> and <client.deleteIndex(indexName, callback)>? There are some great code examples here(https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-index/#examples).

We are always here to help, so don't hesitate to reach out with any further questions or feedback.

Happy searching!
